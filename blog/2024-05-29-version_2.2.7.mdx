This release adds support for Flutter 3.22. 

If you are using Flutter 3.19, I recommend staying on Monarch 2.2.3. 
This latest version of the Monarch controller could not reconcile a 
change between Flutter 3.22 and Flutter 3.19. Due to time constraints, 
I released it without support for Flutter 3.19.
