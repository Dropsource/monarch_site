This release adds support for Flutter 3.9 ([pull request](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/pull/82)). 
Also, Monarch now fully supports Windows 11 and Visual Studio 2022 ([pull request](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/pull/81)).

Lastly, this is the fist Monarch release with downloadable Monarch binaries for Linux. 
Linux users don't have to build the Monarch source code anymore. They can just download it 
from the [install page](https://monarchapp.io/docs/install).
