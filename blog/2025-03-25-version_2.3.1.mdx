This release introduces `monarch.yaml`. ðŸš€

You can use `monarch.yaml` 
to define the devices you want to use with Monarch. This file
should be placed at the root of your project directory. For an example,
please see [samples_booking/monarch.yaml](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch_samples/blob/main/samples_booking/monarch.yaml).

This release also upgrades all monarch dependencies. Monarch now 
uses the latest Dart SDK, Flutter SDKs, and packages.

Monarch now supports Flutter 3.27.0 and greater. Older Flutter SDKs 
are no longer supported. If you need a Flutter SDK that Monarch doesn't
support, you can build Monarch [on your local machine](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/wiki/Setting-up-your-local-development-environment).
