description: Crash detection, hot restart, support Flutter 3.8.
---

Some users may hit an [known Flutter issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/120841)
while reloading their stories which causes a crash. This release detects the
crash and notifies you of the workaround. The workaround is to run monarch with the
hot restart option:
```
monarch run --reload hot-restart
```

This release also 
[fixes hot restart on Windows](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/issues/56) 
and [implements hot restart on Linux](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/issues/70).

Finally, this release 
[adds support for Flutter 3.8](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/issues/80), 
which is currently in beta.
Flutter 3.8 changed an API used by the monarch package. We have updated
the monarch package to support the beta changes.
