description: Support latest versions of analyzer and vm_service packages.

This minor release is mostly for new monarch users.

We recently updated the monarch package to version 2.2.0, which supports the 
latest versions of `analyzer` and `vm_service` packages. 

In this release, the `monarch init` command uses the latest monarch package.

If you have an existing project using monarch, you can just update your 
pubspec.yaml and set `monarch: ^2.2.0`.
