## It's been a minute
We have been heads down working on major improvements to Monarch. Here's a quick update of what's to come.

### Monarch goes open source! ðŸ¤¯   
The next major release of Monarch will be open source. We have changed the Monarch architecture so that most of the code base is in Dart. The new architecture will also help us get contributions from the community. And it lays the infrastructure to support add-ons in Monarch. This work is heavily under way.

### Linux is next! ðŸš€
After we release the open source version of Monarch, Linux will follow. Once most of the Monarch code is in Dart, we will be able to scale and maintain the Monarch Linux version. We are super excited about welcoming Linux users!

### Monarch intro video ðŸ¤“
We now have an intro video which explains Monarch. We love how this intro video turned out. We think it presents what Monarch can do for you very well. Many users had asked for this video and it is finally here. We haven't added the video to the website yet. But you can watch the video in our [YouTube channel](LINK).

### Support for Flutter 3.x
If you upgrade your project to use Flutter 3.x, then make sure to use the `monarch` package version `2.3.0`. We released a [new version](https://monarchapp.io/blog/version-1.7.8) of Monarch which validates your project is using the monarch package that corresponds to the Flutter version it is running.

### Join our team ðŸ‘«
We are looking for Dart Developers (front-end and back-end) and Flutter Writers to join our team. Please send an email to ___ for more details.
