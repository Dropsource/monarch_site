### Intro

`RenderFlex overflowed`. As a Flutter developer you have probably seen this error a
million times. You put together some widgets to make a beautiful UI and it works
perfectly. Until someone runs it on a different device, with a different screen
or font size now your text is overflowing, widgets are overlapping and that
beautiful UI is gone.

Often times we build UIs that work for ideal situations, however, the apps we
make run in the most unexpected conditions and we must be able to take those
situations into account. Our app UIs must be built to withstand as many edge
cases as possible, the different screen and font sizes, languages and even
orientations. However, catching these edge cases is hard, especially for UIs,
not withstanding the fact that edge case testing can be time consuming.

To find edge cases, you need to spend time and play around with your app. It is
through playing that we learn the most about whats possible, impossible and
further what breaks our app UIs.

### Testing on the Edge

Edge cases occur at the extremes of your app's functionality. They often hide
subtle bugs that can wreak your users' experience. Using the below screen that
shows a set of filtering options, let's play around with the device and text
sizes and try to catch some bugs in the related edge cases.

<div className="docs-intro">
  <img
    className="docs-screenshot macos"
    alt="Bottom up slide transition"
    src={edge_case_screen}
    width="260px"
  />
</div>

#### 1. Preview on the Smallest Device

Previewing the screen on the smallest device our app supports helps us identify
issues related to layout, cramped visuals, and overflowing content.

#### 2. Preview on the Largest Device

Next, we'll preview the same screen on the largest device our app supports. This
test ensures your app scales gracefully and doesn't break when elements are
stretched.

#### 3. Small Text Scale Factor

Now, let's change the text scale factor to its smallest value. This might
trigger issues like unreadable content, accessibility, or overlapping elements.

#### 4. Large Text Scale Factor

Here, we'll increase the text scale factor to its maximum value. Observe how the
UI handles this extreme situation. Problems related to text wrapping, oversized
text, or misaligned elements may surface.

Here's a video showing the edge case test with Monarch in action

<div className="blog-video video">
  <div className="text--center">

      autoPlay
      src={edge_case}
      type="video/webm"
    />
  </div>
</div>

### Why you should isolate your widgets

- Isolation gives you more control of the parts of your UI that you can play
  around with and apply edge cases. When you isolate, you can test your edge
  cases on the entire screen, just a section, or down to a single widget like a
  textview or a button. With this level of control, you can test more edge cases
  and debug more efficiently.
- Isolation allows you to test parts of your UI flow without dealing with the
  related business logic, backend, or navigation to access it. For instance, in
  a 3-step login flow, all you'll need to do to access the third step of the
  flow is to write a story for it, and that's it; you have direct access to that
  screen.
- When you isolate your widgets and use Monarch to preview them, you get more
  options to test edge cases related to [themes](/docs/themes),
  [internationalization](docs/internationalization), and device type and size.
  All with little to no hassle.
- Isolating your widgets also makes it much easier to reproduce edge case
  scenarios.

### Automating Edge Case Testing with Monarch

As we advance, we plan to automate edge case testing. Imagine a world where
Monarch automatically previews stories at various edge cases and reports any
errors directly to you. This approach will save time, enhance your app's
reliability, and elevate user satisfaction.

In conclusion, edge case testing is not just an optional step in development;
it's a crucial aspect of building robust and reliable Flutter apps. Monarch,
with its ability to facilitate comprehensive edge case testing, empowers you to
deliver a flawless user experience.
