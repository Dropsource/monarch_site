### Introduction

When building apps with multiple screens, it is essential to make the transitions between them appear seamless 
rather than abrupt. To achieve that, standard practice is to use transition animations(e.g., fade in, slide in, etc.) 
when navigating between screens. However, testing and trying out these interactions in a simple yet scalable manner 
can be tricky, and that's where the need to isolate them comes in.

### Isolating interactions

By isolating your interactions, you can easily play around with different animated transitions by changing their 
durations, behaviour, and patterns until you find the one that works best for your app without changing your main 
codebase. A great custom transition can make your app stand out and more unique.

More importantly, isolating interactions enables you to test them independently without relying on the rest of your 
app or backend data. Like in most apps, the screens in your app often depend on preceding states or backend data. As
 a result, it necessitates navigating through multiple screens each time you want to test an interaction, making the
  process such a hassle and time-consuming. By isolating interactions, you can directly access and play around with 
  your interactions without having to navigate through numerous screens or fulfil business logic every time.


### Writing stories for interactions

To demonstrate how isolation makes your work as a developer easier, let's write some [stories](/docs/write-first-story) for 
the `ExpenseListScreen` shown at the top of the page that transitions into a `DetailsScreen`. Using these stories and
 Monarch Preview, we will play around with our interaction by changing some variables to find an animation we like.

First, let's set up the `ExpenseListWidget`. The widget has three key variables that we'll use to play around with our
 interaction: a `TransitionType`(e.g., slide, rotate, scale), a `Curve` value that defines how the transition will move,
  and a `Duration`.
```dart
class ExpenseListWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<Expense> expenses;
  final TransitionType? transition;
  final Curve? curve;
  final Duration? duration;

  const ExpenseListWidget({ super.key, required this.expenses,
    this.transition, this.curve, this.duration,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ListView.builder(
        itemCount: expenses.length,
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
          var expense = expenses[index];
          return GestureDetector(
            child: ExpenseCard(
              expense: expense,
            ),
            onTap: () {
              Navigator.of(context).push(
                createAnimatedRoute(
                    screen: DetailsScreen(expense: expense),
                    transition: transition,
                    curve: curve,
                    duration: duration),
              );
            },
          );
        });
  }
}
```
### BottomUp Slide Transition

We’ll start off with a basic transition that slides in from the bottom to the top of the screen. To do that we pass 
`TransitionType.slide` and `Curves.ease` to the expense list widget. 

```dart
Widget bottomUpTransition() => ExpenseListWidget(
    expenses: expenses,
    transition: TransitionType.slide,
    curve: Curves.ease);
```

After running the `monarch run` command in the terminal, we can now try out the animation using Monarch Preview like below.

<div className="docs-intro">
    <img className="docs-screenshot macos" alt="Bottom up slide transition" src={bottom_up_slide} width="1000px"/>
</div>

### BottomUp Slide Transition with Bounce

We can try out another a variation of the bottom-up slide that bounces on completion by simply duplicating the previous
 story but changing the curve value to `Curves.bounceOut` .

```dart
Widget bottomUpTransitionWithBounce() => ExpenseListWidget(
    expenses: expenses,
    transition: TransitionType.slide,
    curve: Curves.bounceOut);
```

And then we can similarly interact with it on the preview like below:

<div className="docs-intro">
    <img className="docs-screenshot macos" alt="Bottom up slide transition with bounce" src={bottom_up_slide_bounce} width="1000px"/>
</div>

### Rotation Transition

To try out the rotation transition we simply write a story that sets transition to  `TransitionType.rotate` and curve to 
`Curve.ease`  and to make it more noticeable, set the duration to 800 milliseconds.

```dart
Widget rotationTransition() => ExpenseListWidget(
      expenses: expenses,
      transition: TransitionType.rotate,
      curve: Curves.ease,
      duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 800),
    );
```

And the we have:
<div className="docs-intro">
    <img className="docs-screenshot macos" alt="Rotation transition" src={rotation} width="1000px"/>
</div>

### Slow Rotation Transition

We can also try to make the rotation transition slow by just changing the duration to 4 seconds like below.
<div className="docs-intro">
    <img className="docs-screenshot macos" alt="Rotation transition" src={rotation_slow} width="1000px"/>
</div>

### Leveraging Monarch in your project

With all of your app's interaction stories laid out in the Monarch Preview, you can directly
  reach the widgets and interactions you want to test or debug without having to navigate through multiple screens first. By 
  isolating the preview of your app to a separate window, Monarch has the ability to let you play around with and test out route
   transitions in your app, a feature other alternative tools don’t currently have.
