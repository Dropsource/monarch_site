title: Version 1.3.0
description: Monarch is a tool for building Flutter widgets in isolation. It makes it easy to build, test and debug complex UIs.

This version adds the **Dock** feature.

Monarch uses two windows, one for your story settings and another one to render 
your story. This experience guarantees the visual isolation of the selected story.
However, managing both windows [was cumbersome](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/issues/17).

With the new Dock feature you can manage both windows together. Working with 
Monarch has gotten even easier. ðŸ¤©

When the windows are docked you can move or resize one window and the other one will follow suit. You will see three dock options via the "Dock side" dropdown: 

1. Dock to right
2. Dock to left
3. Undock

To get the new version just do `monarch upgrade`.
