We just released the **Scale** feature.

Now you can scale your stories, i.e. zoom in or out your stories. Previously, it was 
difficult to test stories on a large device, like the iPad Pro, if you were using a 
small screen, like a laptop. Now, even if you are working on your laptop, you can 
select iPad Pro and scale your story down so it fits on your screen.

Also, if you have a large DPI monitor, you can scale up your story so you can see 
it better.

We also fixed a few things on the Monarch Windows app. On Windows, the story window 
will be sized correctly and it will reliably open next to the story list window.
