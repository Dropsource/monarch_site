Hello from Monarch! This is issue 1 of our newsletter, Monarch Minutes. 
We hope you enjoy the updates. 

## New Features in Monarch 1.6

Our latest release (version 1.6) brings debugging to Monarch! Working with 
Monarch keeps getting easier. üôå

### 1. Visual debugging ü§ì üêõ
You can now enable several options to visually debug your stories. And you can launch
DevTools! üöÄ 

Check out our [docs on debugging your story](/docs/debug-your-story).

### 2. Debug your widgets in isolation ü¶æ ü§Ø
With Monarch and DevTools you can now debug your widgets source code in isolation, 
without running the full app.

Find more info in our [docs](/docs/debug-your-story#debug-your-widgets-source-code).

### 3. New devices üì±
We have updated the devices list in Monarch. These are the new devices we have added:

- iPhone 13 (and all its variants)
- iPad 9th Gen
- iPad Pro 5th Gen
- Pixel 5a
- OnePlus 9
- Samsung Galaxy S21
- Moto G Power (2021)

### 4. Error capture
Monarch improves Flutter error messages by providing more context when a story 
generates an error. And now, Monarch captures even more errors than before.

### 5. Support for all Flutter versions
The Flutter team does an amazing job at providing regular releases
of new Flutter versions in the dev, beta and stable channels. When a new Flutter
version is released on any channel, the Monarch build automation starts a new 
Monarch build to support the new version. You can rest assured that Monarch will 
support every version of Flutter as soon 
as they come out. So, when you upgrade to the new Flutter version, Monarch will 
already support it.

We introduced support for all Flutter versions back in May and we are glad to 
see usage of Monarch across many Flutter versions and channels.

## Upcoming Major Features
- We are starting work on Monarch for Linux. ‚ù§Ô∏è
- We are also starting work on another major feature which we are keeping 
  under wraps. Stay tuned!
