This is a major release of Monarch! ðŸŽ‰

After much feedback from the community we have released version 1.0. This version of Monarch enables support for Flutter versions [across all channels](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/issues/11).

Previously Monarch only supported stable versions of Flutter. Now it supports Flutter versions on the beta and dev channels.

This version will also let us easily support new Flutter versions as they are released. And it will make [Linux support](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/issues/16) easier in the future.

This version also reduces the size of the Monarch installation bundle considerably. Previous versions of Monarch shipped support for multiple Flutter versions in the initial bundle. With this new version we don't have to ship all those binaries, the new Monarch CLI will download only the binaries needed to support the version of Flutter your project is running. The size of the initial bundle went from around 100 MB down to 3 MB.

ðŸ’ª ðŸš€ ðŸ¥³

To get the new version just run `monarch upgrade`. If you don't have Monarch you can get it [here](/docs/install).
