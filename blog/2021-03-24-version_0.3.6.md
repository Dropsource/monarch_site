Monarch can now run on flutter projects that are null safe. ðŸ’ª  ðŸŽ‰  ðŸš€

If you already have `package:monarch` in your pubspec.yaml, then just change its version number to `0.2.0`:
```
dev_dependencies:
  ...
  monarch: ^0.2.0
  ...
```
Then run in your terminal:
```shell
flutter pub get
monarch run
```

If you have installed monarch but haven't set it up in your project, the get latest version of monarch via `monarch upgrade`, then do `monarch init` inside your project and then `monarch run`.
