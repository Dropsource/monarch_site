This release brings changes to better support Flutter 3.10. Flutter 
3.10 deprecated some APIs the monarch package and CLI were using.

This latest Monarch release uses the latest and greatest Flutter APIs.
See [pull request #99](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/pull/99) and 
[pull request #100](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/pull/100) for more details.

Also, since Flutter 3.10 made it to stable, then Monarch Linux is 
also stable. Previously you had to be on Flutter beta to use Monarch 
on Linux. Now, you can use Monarch on Linux on the Flutter stable channel.
