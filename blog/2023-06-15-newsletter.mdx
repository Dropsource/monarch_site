It's been 7 months since our last newsletter and we have been busy!

### Monarch is faster üèé üí®
We made Monarch reloads much faster. Based on our metrics the initial reload of stories went from 10 seconds all the way down to 1 second! Subsequent reloads are also faster by as much as 2x.

### Monarch now runs on Linux! üöÄü§ì
Monarch has been running on Linux for a few months. You can run Monarch on Linux in the stable or beta branch. You can also [build Monarch yourself](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/wiki/Setting-up-your-local-development-environment) on any platform. 

We welcome all Linux users to the Monarch community!

### We adapted to change üêõü¶ã
We experienced many changes these past few months:

- The Flutter APIs that Monarch uses changed which caused several breaking changes for us.
- Our users reported several issues in the Monarch repo.
- We now maintain Monarch on all 3 major desktop platforms (macOS, Windows, and Linux).

Some of these changes were unexpected, painful, and hard. We learned to embrace these changes and Monarch is better for it.

- We now have better automation than ever before.
- We improved our test coverage with unit and integration tests.
- We released Monarch 7 times this year alone which helped us improve our release process.
- We have closed more issues in comparison to the number of new issues reported by our users.
- We ended up with better documentation and sample projects.
- We let go of things that were holding us back.

The Monarch growth is real.

### Meetups, conferences
We want Monarch to continue to grow, thus we will get out into the wild more. We will do more meetups and conferences. We will also engage more with the community.

On July 19th, we will be in Charlotte, North Carolina. We will present Monarch to the [Flutter Charlotte](https://www.meetup.com/qc-flutter/events/294208792/) meetup group. If you are in the area, we would love to see you!

We are also thankful that a Monarch user spontaneously [gave a talk](https://twitter.com/schiquiri/status/1641922457710755842) about Monarch at the Flutter Forward Extended event in Nairobi, Kenya. Thank you [@schiquiri](https://twitter.com/schiquiri)!

### Did you know? üßê
- You can use `debugPrint` to print debug statement to the terminal where the Monarch CLI is running. See [Print to the console](https://monarchapp.io/docs/debug-your-story#print-to-the-console).
- The [`monarch_samples` repository](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch_samples) has many sample projects which can help you develop your own widgets in isolation and also apply Monarch in your projects.
- Monarch can render your app's theme via the `@MonarchTheme` annotation. See the [Themes docs](https://monarchapp.io/docs/themes).
- If your app supports multiple languages, Monarch can render your stories using your locales. See the [Internationalization docs](https://monarchapp.io/docs/internationalization).

### Stay tuned
We are super excited about a new experience we are crafting. If we can pull it off it will be super cool and a major value-add to all Monarch users.

Make sure you [subscribe to our newsletter](http://eepurl.com/hJ-S0L) to stay tuned. The future is exciting!
