Hello from Monarch! This is issue 1 of our monthly newsletter, Monarch Minutes. We hope you enjoy the updates. 

## New Features

Our latest release (version 1.6.0) brings debugging to Monarch! Working with 
Monarch keeps getting easier. 🙌

### 1. Visual debugging 🤓 🐛
You can now enable several options to visually debug your stories. And you can launch
DevTools! 🚀 

Check out our [documentation](/docs/debug-your-story).

### 2. Debug your widgets in isolation 🦾 🤯
With Monarch and DevTools you can now debug your widgets source code in isolation, 
without running the full app.

Find more info in our [docs](/docs/debug-your-story#debug-your-widgets-source-code).
