description: Monarch is a tool for building Flutter widgets in isolation. It makes building beautiful apps a simpler and faster experience.
---

Monarch now supports projects that have [disabled sound null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety/unsound-null-safety).

If you run your project using `flutter run --no-sound-null-safety`, now you can use the same
flag when running Monarch.

```
monarch run --no-sound-null-safety
```

You stories can then use your unsound null safe code.
