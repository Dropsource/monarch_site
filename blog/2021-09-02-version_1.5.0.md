This release is compatible with `package:monarch` version 1.0.1 which [fixes 
and improves](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/issues/25) how stories interact with modals, alerts and routing.

We will also start publishing a newsletter, which will include the latest 
Monarch updates, features and news. [Sign up here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfD9L92rymZnf-z18hWj0gyqrnBFNcc7U3YB3QyiI0_3PMxhQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

This new version of the Monarch CLI will also let you sign up to the newsletter
straight from the command line.
