This is the second edition of our newsletter Monarch Minutes. We continue to
improve the Monarch developer experience. We also improved the docs, samples 
and website.

## New Features in Monarch 1.7

### 1. Faster reloads üí® üöÄ

Version 1.7 improves the reloading experience in Monarch. In previous versions,
every change in your project would trigger a hot restart. Now, with the new version,
every change will trigger a hot reload by default. Hot reloading will make code 
changes render much faster on the Monarch UI.

You can still force a hot restart via the new key commands.

Also, if you want to control how Monarch reloads, you can use the new `--reload`
flag. See the [CLI Usage](/docs/cli-usage) docs.

### 2. Bug fixes and support for macOS Monterrey üêõ
This new release fixes several issues:
- Dragging on the Monarch story window with your mouse now behaves like touch drag on a 
  mobile device. You can now test mobile drag interactions like scrolling and 
  pull-down to refresh.
- Fixed an issue during termination of the Monarch CLI.
- Fixed an issue on macOS to better support multiple monitors with different 
  screen resolutions.

We also added macOS Monterrey support in Monarch 1.7.

## Updated samples and docs ü§ì üìö
We updated and augmented the samples in the 
[monarch_samples](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch_samples) repo. 
The samples repo now includes several projects which showcase how to 
use Monarch with:

- intl tools and package
- a pretty booking theme
- riverpod
- several other patterns like bloc, cubit, lists, provider, dialogs, 
  animations, navigation, etc.

We also updated our docs to reflect the latest changes in Flutter and Monarch.


## New Monarch videos ü§©
We updated the videos on the [Monarch landing page](/). The new videos show Monarch 
in action with a beautiful UI. If you want to see the stories and code for the videos, 
you can get them from the 
[booking sample project](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch_samples/tree/master/samples_booking).


<div className="text--center">
    <video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} playsInline={true}>

    <source src="/assets/booking-build-hevc.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>
