### Fix on macOS
This release fixes the macOS error "Could not create the embedder backing 
store". This error is hard to reproduce consistently but we think we have a 
good fix for it. However, if you see it again, please let us know by 
creating an issue in the monarch Github repo.


### Performance Overlay
This release adds a new visual debugging flag, called Show Performance Overlay.
This flag is part of the Flutter tools and now you can access it directly from 
Monarch. For more details on how to use this flag, see the Flutter docs on 
[The performance overlay](https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/ui-performance#the-performance-overlay).

Also, to use this new flag you need to upgrade the monarch package in your 
pubspec.yaml: 
- If you are using Flutter 3.8 or later, then please upgrade to monarch package `^3.6.0`. 
- Or, if you are using Flutter 3.7 or earlier, then please upgrade to monarch `^3.1.1`.
