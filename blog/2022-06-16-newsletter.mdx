## It's been a minute
We have been heads down working on major improvements to Monarch. Here's a 
quick update of what's to come.

### Monarch goes open source! 🤯   
The next major release of Monarch will be open source. We have changed the 
Monarch architecture so that most of the code base is in Dart. The new 
architecture will also help us get contributions from the community. And 
it lays the infrastructure to support add-ons in Monarch. This work is 
heavily under way.

### Linux is next! 🚀
After we release the open source version of Monarch, Linux will follow. 
Once most of the Monarch code is in Dart, we will be able to scale and 
maintain the Monarch Linux version. We are super excited about welcoming 
Linux users!

### Monarch intro video 🤓
We now have an intro video which explains Monarch. We love how this intro 
video turned out. We think it presents what Monarch can do for you very well. 
Many users had asked for this video and it is finally here.

### Support for Flutter 3.x
If you upgrade your project to use Flutter 3.x, then make sure to use 
the `monarch` package version `2.3.0`. We released a 
[new version](https://monarchapp.io/blog/version-1.7.8) of Monarch which 
validates your project is using the monarch package that corresponds to 
the Flutter version it is running.

### New Monarch branding 💟
We updated our logo, brand colors, fonts and revised the website content.
We hope you like the new changes!
