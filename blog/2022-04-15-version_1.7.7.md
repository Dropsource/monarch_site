description: Support new Flutter beta release.

The Flutter team released beta version `2.13.0-0.1.pre` which included 
a [breaking change](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/46756). 

Since Monarch supports all Flutter versions, we updated Monarch to 
support both the new behavior and also the legacy behavior from the 
breaking change.
