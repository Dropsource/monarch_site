title: Version 1.7.6
description: Support new Flutter beta release and upgrade improvements
---

The Flutter team released a beta version of Flutter which changed some 
interfaces that the monarch package depends on. This release makes sure
you can use Monarch with Flutter beta version `2.12.0-4.1.pre`.

Also, we have improved the `monarch upgrade` process:

1. When you run `monarch upgrade`, the CLI will first validate your 
   Monarch installation.
2. If the validation is successful, then it will move your old Monarch
   files to a temp directory, and then install the new ones.
3. If the validation fails, the CLI will inform you why it failed.

Last weekend, some users reported a severe bug in the upgrade process 
which was deleting local files. Within two hours of the report, 
we changed our remote API so upgrade requests would be rejected, which 
prevents the upgrade process from running, which prevents the bug from 
manifesting. 

If you are running Monarch 1.7.4 or older then you are getting this 
notification when you execute `monarch run`:

```
********************************************************************************
Monarch 1.7.6 is available. You are on 1.7.3. You should use the latest version.

There is a bug in the current version of the `monarch upgrade` process and we 
have disabled it. To get the latest version of Monarch go to the website and 
install it as if it was a fresh install: https://monarchapp.io/docs/install.
********************************************************************************
```

Please follow the steps in the notification to install the new version of 
Monarch.
