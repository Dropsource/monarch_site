### Monarch is now fully open source! ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¤©
We are super excited about this announcement. We put in a lot of work into this release. It 
took us longer than we expected because we run into unexpected issues. However, 
we are very proud of what we have accomplished.

As we open sourced Monarch, we also drastically changed the Monarch architecture. 
This new architecture makes Monarch more maintainable. Monarch now reuses more 
Flutter and Dart code across all platforms. It also makes contributions from the community easier. 
And it sets Monarch up for future features like add-ons and CI integrations.

All the Monarch source code is in our main [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch). 
If you would like to contribute please start by reading our 
[Contribution Guide](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you would like to start using Monarch 2.x, please 
[install it](https://monarchapp.io/docs/install). Or, if you already have Monarch 
installed, just run `monarch upgrade`.

### Search ðŸ”Ž
Monarch now lets you search your stories. There are teams that have hundreds 
of stories. The search feature is a nice addition to the Monarch experience.

### Windows users
The new version of Monarch (Monarch 2.x) uses gRPC. The Monarch local processes 
use gRPC to communicate with each other. If you are on Windows, you may be 
prompted to "allow monarch.exe to communicate over your network". Please 
"Allow access" to use Monarch on your Windows machine.


### Flutter 2.x users
Monarch 2.x supports Flutter 3.x. If you are still on Flutter 2.x then please 
upgrade your Flutter version or remain using Monarch 1.x. 
See [Install for Flutter 2.x](/docs/install_flutter2x).
