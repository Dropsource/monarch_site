Tweaks, or adjustments, are very important in UI development. Tweaking is the difference between a good UI and a great UI because:

- a lot of subtle changes are significant,
- you need to tweak to polish the details, and
- a great UI is all about the details.

A tweak is small, therefore, if you have to do a **big setup** to see a **small change**, then there is an imbalance. If you have to run builds, boot up local servers, set up data, etc. to do a tweak, then there is an imbalance.

**That imbalance is painful.**

That pain is something you, subconsciously, are going to want to stay away from. And since you are not tweaking as much, then the quality of your UI suffers.

What if we could re-balance our work? How can we make tweaking more efficient?

You can isolate your UI and use Monarch. When your UI is isolated, the setup you need to run your UI is very small. So when you need to tweak, you don't need to do much to get started.

As you tweak small changes in code, like we are doing below, you see those reflected immediately as you would expect, and you can check how those changes affected other screens with just one click.

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} playsInline={true}>
    <source src="/assets/animation-tweaks.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
<br/>
<br/>

All of it without doing any big setup.

**With Monarch, you can tweak, tweak, tweak** to your hearts content in a short amount of time, which gives you lots and lots of feedback.
