title: Hard-to-reach use cases are painful

A use case in an app is hard to reach when you have to take many steps to get to it, or when you have to 
spend energy setting things up so you can reach it. 
An example of a hard to reach use cases is the last step of an onboarding screen or an onboarding workflow.

To reach that last step we need to follow all these steps:

1. Launch the Simulator
1. Launch the app, wait while that loads
1. Realize you are already logged in
1. Uninstall the app
1. Install it again
1. Launch the app
1. Tap on 1st onboarding screen
1. Tap on 2nd onboarding screen
1. Tap on 3rd, 4th, 5th onboarding screen
1. Now you can start your work
1. Do it again for your next change

**This is frustrating and painful.**

What if we didn't have to go through this pain? How can we remove all these impediments? 
How can we make this use case easy to reach?

That's where Monarch comes in.

With Monarch we can write stories for each piece of the onboarding flow we want to isolate. 
This way we don't have to run the app or go through the onboarding flow. Here you can see a 
couple of the stories we could write for this app:

```dart
...
Widget onboarding_2_relax() =>
    IntroductionAnimationScreen(initial: 1, target: 2);
...
Widget onboarding_5_welcome() =>
    IntroductionAnimationScreen(initial: 4, target: 5);
```

And here you see those stories in Monarch. We can now go to the first onboarding step, then the second,
and from there we can go straight to the last step. The last step, which was so hard to reach before, 
is now just one click away. 

<video autoPlay={true} muted={true} loop={true} playsInline={true}>
    <source src="/assets/animation-onboarding.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    <source src="/assets/animation-onboarding.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>

From here we can change the code and Monarch will reflect those changes immediately. 

As you can see, we don't need any of the steps we used to have to take to reach this use case. 
We don't need to run simulator, we don't need to uninstall and install the app, we don't have 
to tap multiple times.

**With Monarch your entire UI is just one click away.**
