Widget tests are hard because we need to set up data for them and because we write them blind. We can't see the screen we are testing when we write a widget test.

Here is an example widget test.

```dart
testWidgets('Has Favorite button', (WidgetTester tester) async {

  // PRE-CONDITION
  Widget screen = CourseDetailsScreen(
    course: Course(
      imagePath: 'assets/design_course/team.png',
      title: 'Flutter Programming',
      lessonCount: 12,
      money: 250,
      rating: 4.8,
      isActive: true,
      categoryType: CategoryType.coding,
    ),
    onBack: (p0) => null,
  );

  // ACTION
  await tester.pumpWidget(screen);

  // VERIFICATION
  expect(find.byIcon(Icons.favorite), findsOneWidget);

});
```

This widget test, like any other test, has three major parts: the pre-condition where we set up the UI we want to test, then there is the action, which may be just rendering the pre-condition, and the final step is the verification of the results.

In a widget test, **the hardest part to write is the pre-condition**. This is the part that we need to see what it looks like. You write the code for it but you can't see what the output of that pre-condition will look like on the screen.

The pre-condition is also where we need to set up the most data.

What if writing the pre-condition of widget test was easy? What if you could see what the pre-condition looks like?

Monarch makes this possible because the pre-condition of a widget test is a story. Thus, we can go from the previous example to the one below, notice the pre-condition:

```dart
testWidgets('Has Favorite button', (WidgetTester tester) async {

  // PRE-CONDITION
  Widget screen = details_active();

  // ACTION
  await tester.pumpWidget(screen);

  // VERIFICATION
  expect(find.byIcon(Icons.favorite), findsOneWidget);

});
```

We are re-using the story `details_active`. With Monarch you can **re-use your stories inside your widget tests**. First, you write the story, then you can see what that looks like in Monarch, then you re-use it from your widget test. You can now be confident that your precondition is exactly what you want.

**Writing widgets tests with monarch is easy.** And a test that is easy to write, it's also easy to maintainâ€”which is huge.
