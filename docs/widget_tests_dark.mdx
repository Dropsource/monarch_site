Widget tests are hard to write because we need to set up data for them and because 
we can't see the screen we are testing.

Here is an example widget test.

```dart
testWidgets('Has Favorite button', (WidgetTester tester) async {

  // PRE-CONDITION
  Widget screen = CourseDetailsScreen(
    course: Course(
      imagePath: 'assets/design_course/team.png',
      title: 'Flutter Programming',
      lessonCount: 12,
      money: 250,
      rating: 4.8,
      isActive: true,
      categoryType: CategoryType.coding,
    ),
    onBack: (p0) => null,
  );

  // ACTION
  await tester.pumpWidget(screen);

  // VERIFICATION
  expect(find.byIcon(Icons.favorite), findsOneWidget);

});
```

This widget test, like any other test, has three major parts: the pre-condition 
where we set up the UI we want to test; the action, which may be 
just rendering the pre-condition; and finally, the verification of 
the results.

In a widget test, **the hardest part to write is the pre-condition**. This is 
the part where we really need to see what it looks like. You write the code for it 
but you can't see what the output of that pre-condition will look like on the 
screen.

The pre-condition is also where we need to set up the most data.

What if writing the pre-condition of widget test was easy? What if you could 
see what the pre-condition looks like?

Monarch makes this possible because the pre-condition of a widget test is a 
story. Thus, we can go from the previous example to the one below, notice 
the pre-condition:

```dart
testWidgets('Has Favorite button', (WidgetTester tester) async {

  // PRE-CONDITION
  Widget screen = details_active();

  // ACTION
  await tester.pumpWidget(screen);

  // VERIFICATION
  expect(find.byIcon(Icons.favorite), findsOneWidget);

});
```

We are re-using the story `details_active`. With Monarch you can **re-use your 
stories inside your widget tests**. First, you write the story, then you can 
see what that looks like in Monarch, then you re-use it from your widget test. 
You can now be confident that your precondition is exactly what you want.

**Writing widgets tests with Monarch is easy** and a test that is easy to 
write is also easy to maintainâ€”which is huge.
