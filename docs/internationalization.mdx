If your application is internationalized (or localized), Monarch can render your 
stories using the locales you have declared in code. To do so, Monarch 
needs to know about your locales via the `MonarchLocalizations` annotation. 

1. Add the `package:monarch_annotations` to your dependencies:
```yaml
dependencies:
  monarch_annotations: ^1.0.0
``` 

2. Annotate a const value or getter of your `LocalizationsDelegate` using the 
`MonarchLocalizations` annotation. 
```dart
import 'package:monarch_annotations/monarch_annotations.dart';
...

class MyLocalizationsDelegate extends LocalizationsDelegate<MyLocalizations> {...}

@MonarchLocalizations([MonarchLocale('en', 'US'), MonarchLocale('es')])
const myLocalizationsDelegate = MyLocalizationsDelegate();
```
The `MonarchLocalizations` annotation takes a list of `MonarchLocale` items. Declare 
a `MonarchLocale` for each locale your application supports.

:::info
If your project uses the Dart intl tools, then your `LocalizationsDelegate` is automatically 
generated by the intl tools. To annotate it, you will have to create a new dart library 
in your lib directory, then import the generated source file so you can annotate an 
instance of your `LocalizationsDelegate`. For an example see 
[this sample project](https://github.com/Dropsource/monarch_samples/tree/master/samples_intl_tools) 
which uses Monarch and the intl package and tools.

3. Save your changes. The Monarch app will display your locales in the Locale dropdown.
When you select a locale, the selected story will render using the selected locale.
