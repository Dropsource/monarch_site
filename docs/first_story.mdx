Monarch is inspired by [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Conceptually, 
Monarch stories are the same as Storybook stories. If you are familiar with 
Storybook, then Monarch will feel very familiar.

You can write stories for every interesting or relevant state your widgets 
may have.

### Stories in code
Stories are simple functions that return a `Widget` and take zero arguments. You 
don't need to import the monarch package to write a story.

Also, since stories are plain functions, they can be re-used from your widget tests.


### Where to put stories
Monarch will look for stories in dart files that end with `*_stories.dart`.

You can place stories inside the `stories` directory or, if you prefer, you can 
place them inside your `lib` directory. The only requirement is that story files 
should end in `*_stories.dart`.


### Sample stories
The `monarch init` command creates the file `stories\sample_button_stories.dart`. You 
can open that file to see how those stories are written. After you run 
`monarch run` you should see those stories in the Monarch desktop app.

You should see something like this:

<Tabs
  groupId="operating-systems"
  defaultValue="mac"
  values={[
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'mac'},
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
  ]
}>
  <TabItem value="mac">
    <img className="docs-screenshot macos" alt="my_project macOS sample stories" src={my_project_macos_sample_stories}/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win">
    <img className="docs-screenshot windows" alt="my_project Windows sample stories" src={my_project_windows_sample_stories}/>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Feel free to edit those stories to see their visual state change. Monarch will 
automatically reload your changes.

### Stories for your own widgets
Let's say your project has a couple of widgets files. One is inside `lib`
and one inside `lib\src`.

```
- my_project
    - lib
        - my_fancy_button.dart
        - src
            - my_fancy_card.dart
```

To write stories for those widgets, you just need to import them into a 
`*_stories.dart` file, then you can write stories for those widgets.
```dart
// stories/my_stories.dart
import 'package:my_project/my_fancy_button.dart';
import 'package:my_project/src/my_fancy_card.dart';

Widget someButton => MyFancyButton(...);
Widget anotherButton => MyFancyButton(...);

Widget someCard => MyFancyCard(...);
Widget anotherCard => MyFancyCard(...);
```

After you run `monarch run` you should see those stories in the Monarch desktop 
app.


### Stories for quick prototypes
You can write stories that use the Flutter widgets directly. It is a good way to prototype new views.
For example, in a file that ends in `*_stories.dart`, you can add these stories:

```dart
Widget foo() => Text('foo', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 50));
Widget bar() => Icon(Icons.pets, size: 50);
Widget foobar() => Center(child: Column(children: [foo(), bar()]));
```
